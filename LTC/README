1. use the perl script gethtr-2args.pl to gather information about the turn-on numbers for each LAT VCHP,
and append the daily summary lines to the file "htr.history".

gethtr-2args.pl takes 2 command line arguments: the starting date and the ending date, for getting daily VCHP statistics.

./gethtr-2args.pl 2013-09-06 2013-09-15 >> htr.history

NOTE: the ordering of the VCHP numbers in the file "htr.history" is 
VCHP00
VCHP06
VCHP07
then other the other 9 VCHPs in numerical order, if they are turned on at all during the given day (typically not).
for each VCHP, 3 numbers are written to the line in the output file: 
 - VCHP# (e.g. 00, 06, 07, 11); 
 - the number of samples in telemetry for that day for that VCHP (typically 7353 or 7354)
 - the number of telemetry samples in that day where that VCHP is turned on (typically ranges from 0 to a few hundred)

=======NEW INFO===========
1. check for time gaps in the heater history file:
./xhtr.py < htr.history

2. to manually update the heater history file:
./gethtr-0args.pl >> htr.history

3. to keep the heater history file up to date by cron job:
./LTC/gethtr-1day.pl >> ./LTC/htr.history

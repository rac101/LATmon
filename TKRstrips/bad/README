1. to get a summary per layer of the dead chans, and dead channel total per tower and per LAT:
./xxmlTKR.pl XML/LAT_BadStrips_NN.xml > sum.NN

2. transcribe the latest bad strips summary from each line of the file "count" updated in step 1, 
into the ISOC Drive Google spreadsheet: "tkr-stripmask-trending.xlsx", into the worksheet called "Ground-BadStrips"

3. ensure that difference counts are calculated in columns V to AL in the new row you just added in step 2.

4. copy the new row's number into cell A3 of the spreadsheet.  
The 4x4 grid of the bad strips per TKR tower is then automatically made in the spreadsheet, 
and can be copied to your powerpoint presentation.

5. to identify the layers having more than (say) 100 bad strips, use:
./xworst.pl < sum.NN

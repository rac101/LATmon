The files and scripts in this directory support Fermi LAT mission planning
Robert Cameron, March 2016

Key scripts are run by cron: see ~/cron.MP

Fermi mission planning support/review scripts
      fakeATS.pl
      makeATS.pl
      filistEphem.pl
      filistSAA.pl
      moveMPfiles.pl

Programs summaries: 
filistEphem.pl: maintain an up-to-date list of GLAST ephemeris reports

filistSAA.pl: maintain an up-to-date list of SAA reports

fakeATS.pl (or fakeATSReview-of.pl, which outputs to $mpmw.revfake)
takes no command line arguments. Looks for my cron-updated listings of SAA reports
and GLAST ephemeris files to get latest versions to use. Makes a product that can 
be diffed against a .csv copy of the "ATS Review" product from the MP webviewer.
Calculates appropriate MW from run date.
    ARGS: None
    SWITCHES (all optional)
    	     -p ("plan")  # flag: 1 = "Planned", 0 = "ATSreview" for type of fake MPV product produced
             -f ("force") # flag: 1 = run to completion even if dates are wrong or outfile exists
             -o ("ofile") # flag: 1 = send output to a file with standard name starting with MW
             -n=NNN ("week=i") # integer value for argument that sets the Mission Week to be planned
    OUTPUT: file can be diffed against a .csv copy of plan review product from the MP webviewer.
    CRON: Suitable for running weekly by cron.
    REVIEW: suited - baseline product is available on the "Planned" or "ATS Review" tab in the MP webviewer. 
    CAVEATS: output only includes commands for LPASTOP, LPASTART, LATBIASVUP and LATSUROMDUMP  

makeATS.pl (or makeATS-of.pl, which outputs to $mpmw.atsfake)
Looks for my cron-updated listings of SAA reports and GLAST ephemeris files 
to get latest versions to use. Also can use ATS database to get starting values 
for runID and tranID. Calculates appropriate MW from run date.
    ARGS (optional): starting-runID starting-tranID 
    SWITCHES (all optional): 	 
	      -force (-f): run even if output filename already exists and dates are wrong
	      -getid (-g): read the file LATATSfake.history to get best guess 
	      	      	    starting values for runID and tranID
    	      -ofile (-o): output faked ATS to the filename $MPMW.atsfake 
	      	     	   or to $MPMW.ats0fake if all runIDs and tranIDs = 0
	      -track (-t): add IDs for the planned week to the file LATATSfake.history
    NOTE: script will use 0 for all runIDs and tranIDs if none are supplied or gotten
    OUTPUT: can be diffed against the weekly ATS text file that is FastCopied to NASA.
    CRON: Suitable for running weekly by cron.
    REVIEW: not suited - too late

2makeATS.pl
Looks for my cron-updated listings of SAA reports and GLAST ephemeris files 
to get latest versions to use. Only sets 0 for runID and tranID values. 
Calculates appropriate MW from run date.
    SWITCHES (all optional): 	 
	      -force (-f): run even if output filename already exists and dates are wrong
    	      -ofile (-o): output faked ATS to the filename $MPMW.ats2fake 
    NOTE: to be followed by running script "updateIDs.pl" to set correct runID and tranID values.
    OUTPUT: can be diffed against the weekly ATS text file that is FastCopied to NASA.
    CRON: Suitable for running weekly by cron.
    REVIEW: not suited - too late

moveMPfiles.pl
Copies output files from the "-of.pl" versions of the above scripts to the www-ops
directory.
   ARGS: none
   OUTPUT: none
   CRON: yes
   REVIEW: makes files MP available for review in www-ops 

updateIDs.pl
Meant to be run on output file $MPMW.ats2fake or $MPMW.ats0fake, to add runID and tranID values.
    INPUT: via STDIN: $MPMW.ats2fake or $MPMW.ats0fake. 
    READS: LATATSfake.history
    SWITCHES (optional): 	 
	      -track (-t): add IDs for the planned week to the file LATATSfake.history
    OUTPUT: can be diffed against the weekly ATS text file that is FastCopied to NASA.
    CRON: not readily suitable for running weekly by cron.
    REVIEW: not suited - too late

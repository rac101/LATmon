Monitor LAT CAL calibrations

here is the path to the XML files for the photodiode gains (as MeV to DAC units):

/nfs/farm/g/glast/u/chehtman/calibGenCAL_analysis/calib_for_pass7reproc
or
/afs/slac.stanford.edu/g/glast/ground/releases/calibrations/CAL/p7repro

gain files are listed in "gainfiles" (as of August 2014)

on my laptop: 
plots for quarterly reviews are made in the spreadsheet: MPD.xlsx

simple filtering of the XML files:

grep -i "<mevperdac small" fit_proton_calib_418m_422m_bigsum.calMPD.xml
produces 1536 lines of the form:
<mevPerDac smallSig="1.742690" bigVal="0.401917" smallVal="21.741199" bigSig="0.032216">
<mevPerDac smallSig="1.687350" bigVal="0.395347" smallVal="21.050699" bigSig="0.031690">

STEPS
================

1. use the script "allprogain.pl" on the SLAC farm to calculate values to go into the spreadsheet on the laptop:

mv runall.output runall.output.old
ls -1 ./GMU-CAL-XML/*proton_cal*PD.xml | allprogain.pl > runall.output
diff runall.output runall.output.old

2. add the new lines to the Google Doc spreadsheet in the ISOC Team Drive: CAL-ground-calibration
and redo the plots in the spreadsheet. These plots are shown in the LAT report for Fermi Quarterly Reviews, and at LAT Collaboration meetings.

a script to check IOTL files delivered to SLAC from the MOC.

x4iotl.pl

It is invoked in /u/gl/rac/cron.MP (which is run hourly in cron), using:
x4iotl.pl >| /afs/slac/www/exp/glast/ops/IOTLcheck.txt

The script checks for incoming IOTL files over the past few days, 
and compares "actual" and "expected" LAT commands in found IOTLs. 
This check should be done before approving a weekly ATS in the TMT.

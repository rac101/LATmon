Keep a running mission history of LAT Configuration verify errors
See: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/ISOC/LATC+Verify+Errors

Use commands of the form:
DiagRet.py -b "2008-06-01 00:00:00" -e "+31 days" -m | grep DIFFER

the Bash script "2loops-check-all" was used to complile a complete list of configuration mis-compares over the Fermi mission

In the "dumps" sub-directory, do "pretty" LATC/LCFG dumps for each error

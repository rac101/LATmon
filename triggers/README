to collect data to go into the updated version of Eric Siskind's spreadsheet
to track the LAT daily event rate, do the following:

"gem.sent" is the master ASCII file tracking the daily LHKGEMSENT counter

0. set up the ISOC environment
rac> isocops

1. check the dates to be used with the script buildlist.pl:
./buildlist.pl
37 lines read from gem.sent : the last valid date is 2011-06-06
MnemRet.py -b '2011-06-07 13:27:00' -e '+45 seconds' LHKGEMSENT | sample.pl
MnemRet.py -b '2011-06-08 13:27:00' -e '+45 seconds' LHKGEMSENT | sample.pl
MnemRet.py -b '2011-06-09 13:27:00' -e '+45 seconds' LHKGEMSENT | sample.pl

2. if things look ok from step 1, update the file gem.sent 
./triglist.pl >> gem.sent

3. to confirm that "gem.sent" is up to date, re-run buildlist.pl
./buildlist.pl
40 lines read from gem.sent : the last valid date is 2011-06-09
gem.sent is up to date

4. to get the one column of interest for copy and paste to the spreadsheet, do:
tail -20 gem.sent |  perl -ane 'print "$F[4]\n"'

4. to check the time continuity of history of daily GEM SENT count, use xsent.py;
./xgems.py < gem.sent

HOT NEWS for 2012: 
-----------------
the file trigrate.jana in the "jana" sub-directory is also being updated, 
for making the LAT trigger rate plot in the second worksheet of the SSR
data rate plot on that worksheet.

===============================================================

here's what you have to do when the LAT is rebooted for any reason
(typically starting a new FSW build)

1. find the date and time of the LAT reboot, e.g. from the LAT Diary in Confluence

2. isocops (if not already done)

3. MnemRet.py -b '2011-10-12 16:15:00' -e '+245 seconds' LHKGEMSENT > restart.2011oct12

4. Get the last LHKGEMSENT before the reboot, and the first LHKGEMSENT after the reboot

------

FYI, here is a handy way to get the "seconds from 1970" timestamp 
for a UTC date/time for the lines returned by MnemRet.py
date -u -d '2010-09-12 13:27:22' +%s
1284298042

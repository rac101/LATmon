This is the area where numbers are generated for the "Trigger Rate Daily" worksheet in the SSR spreadsheet, 
where the recent plot of daily trigger rate versus date is made (starting from 2012 January 1).

NOTE: Jana uses her python script with the -nocreep option in this way:
TriggerRate.py -b '-12 days' -e '2012-05-29 00:00:00' -d -n | perl -ape 's/[-:]/ /g; s/\/day//g; s/[\(\)]//g; s/kHz//' >> trigrate.jana

Which is run daily by cron job (trscrontab on lnxcron.slac.stanford.edu)  
using the perl script "getrigs.pl" as in:
./getrigs.pl >> trigrate.jana

to get columns of numbers for transcribing into the spreadsheet, from lines:
 Daily Ave  2012 07 21 00 00 03   2012 07 22 00 00 12           154883902 triggers / 86408 sec  >      1792.5 Hz/day     1.792 kHz/day
 Daily Ave  2012 07 22 00 00 00   2012 07 23 00 00 10           155141504 triggers / 86410 sec  >      1795.4 Hz/day     1.795 kHz/day

tail -100 trigrate.jana | perl -ane 'print "$F[14]\t$F[17]\t$F[-2]\n"'

# to check the time continuity of history of daily trigger count, use xtrig.pl
# usage: 
./xtrig.pl < trigrate.jana
./xtrigr.py < trigrate.jana
